                    <h3>About Me</h3>
                    <p>When I was younger I was not even able to color in the lines and there is nobody in my family that is crafty. Growing up I wanted to be an architect and that is when I started enjoying drawing and coloring.  
                    Crafts ended up being a hobby of mine about five years ago when my husbands' grandma had a paint by number that she wanted me to complete for her. After that was finished, she started teaching me how to crochet and I took it a step further and 
                    started making three-dimensional creatures called amigarumi. This was the start of me enjoying crafts and do-it-yourself projects.</p>

                    <h3>Paint by Numbers</h3>
                    <p>I really enjoy painting but I am not creative to be able to paint from scratch. Paint by numbers have given me the opportunity to paint with directions already on the canvas. Paint by numbers usually take a few days for me to finally finish because I tend to start painting the easy "bigger" areas and
                    by the time I get to the tiny spots I am tired of working on it.I have completed nine paint by numbers in the past five years.</p><br>

                    <h3>Crochet</h3>
                    <p>My husbands' grandma taught me how to crochet and I found it to be a slow, boring craft but I was good at it. I am still slowly working on a blanket that I started at least three years ago and it's not even close to being done. 
                    I turned the basics that she showed me and found a challenging hobby called amigarumi. Amigarumi is crocheting but with a three-dimensional twist. I taught myself this by watching youtube videos and finding patterns online. My favorite was this owl I made a few years ago. This owl
                    took me about six to eight hours to complete. I have done projects that are much smaller and can be completed within two to four hours.</P>

                    <h3>Pyrography</h3>
                    <p>A.K.A wood burning. I took up wood burning out of the blue one winter. I normally find templates online and can then use tracing paper to put them on the wood planks. This is a fun project and anyone can do it. I have done some neat projects and all it takes is the template and the wood burning tool from Hobby Lobby. 
                    The pieces I usually create take about four to eight hours to complete.</p><br>

                    <h3>Cross Stitching</h3>
                    <p>Cross Stitching is a very easy and cheap project that anyone can do. You can buy templates at the store that have instructions on them or you can find templates online and follow those with your own color thread. Cross stitching can be done anywhere by anyone.</p>

                    <h3>Legos</h3>
                    <p>Legos have been one of my most recent hobbies/crafts within the past year. I bought my first few Modular Lego sets on Thanksgiving of 2016 and that started my collection
                    and obsession with Legos. My husband found a lady in the town next to us selling six Modular Lego sets and we went and bought three of them. Within the next few days I
                    realized this was something I loved and we called the lady back and went to buy the last three that she had. Needless to say, this started a very expensive hobby. As of
                    right now, I have all the Modular Lego sets available besides the first two. These run at $1,000 and above and that is the reason behind them being missing from my collection.
                    Someday they will be mine! In the picture there are about nine modular building sets. These take an average of 16 - 24 hours to complete.</p><br>
