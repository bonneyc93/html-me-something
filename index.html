        <p>I am unsure of where I found my love for arts and crafts because when I was younger I couldn't even color in the lines. 
            Crafts ended up being a hobby of mine about five years ago when my husbands' grandma had a paint by number that she 
            wanted me to complete. After that was finished, she started teaching me how to crochet and I took it a step farther and 
            started making three-dimensional creatures. My new found hobby had flourished from there into some neat projects that I 
            will show you. </p>
