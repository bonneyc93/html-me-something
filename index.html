        <p>I am unsure of where I found my love for arts and crafts because when I was younger I couldn't even color in the lines. 
            Crafts ended up being a hobby of mine about five years ago when my husbands' grandma had a paint by number that she 
            wanted me to complete. After that was finished, she started teaching me how to crochet and I took it a step farther and 
            started making three-dimensional creatures. My new found hobby had flourished from there into some neat projects that I 
            will show you. </p>
       
        <h3>Paint by Numbers</h3>

        <h3>Legos</h3>
            <p>Legos have been one of my most recent hobbies/crafts within the past year. I bought my first few Modular Lego sets on Thanksgiving of 2016 and that started my collection
                and obsession with Legos. My husband found a lady in the town next to us selling six Modular Lego sets and we went and bought three of them. Within the next few days I
                realized this was something I loved and we called the lady back and went to buy the last three that she had. Needless to say, this started a very expensive hobby. As of
                right now, I have all the Modular Lego sets available besides the first two. These run at $1,000 and above and that is the reason behind them being missing from my collection.
                Someday they will be mine!</p>
